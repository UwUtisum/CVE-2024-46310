# FiveM-CVE-2024-46310-POC
POC for CVE-2024-46310 For FXServer version's v9601 and prior <br>

Incorrect Access Control in FXServer version's v9601 and prior, for CFX.re FiveM, allows unauthenticated users to modify and read userdata via exposed api endpoint

## How to use the script

navigate to [servers.fivem.net](https://servers.fivem.net) <br>
pick a server <br>
copy the join code <br>
and enter it into the script provided in this repository <br>

using this exposed api endpoint we can get the ip address associated with server and user data however when this endpoint is closed it will not fix the issue of every server running FXServer version's v9601 and prior having an exposed /players.json file that unauthenticated users can view and push changes to

## Example of data unauthenticated users can obtain

    {
    "endpoint": "127.0.0.1", (always 127.0.0.1)
    "id": 328, [ingame session ID]
